This is nextjs sandbox. I'm testing different components and learning how to connect pieces together, it's not meant to work.


Packages to install:

```bash
npm install @heroicons/react
npm install clsx
npx shadcn@latest init -d
npx shadcn@latest add form button input textarea chart calendar popover
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

If it doesn't work check [this link](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19#recharts) ("Add the following to your package.json") because it's React 19 and it worked (but it supposedly shouldn't)
