This is nextjs sandbox. I'm testing different components and learning how to connect pieces together, it's not meant to work.


Packages to install:

npm install @heroicons/react
npm install clsx
npx shadcn@latest init -d
npx shadcn@latest add button


To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
